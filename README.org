~cricbuzz.el~ uses extended ~org-mode~ for keeping schedule and scorecards. The
schedule is written to ~$HOME/.cricbuzz.el/cricbuzz-index.cbi~ (change variable
~cricbuzz-cache-dir~ to change this directory). Game scorecards are kept in
~cricbuzz-cache-dir~ with name like ~<match-name>.cb~. *LIVE* and *FINISHED* cycle as
/TODO/ tags. *PROPERTIES* drawers keep venue and other descriptions.

** Usage
+ ~cricbuzz-get-live-scores~ fetches a list of current cricket matches.
+ ~cricbuzz-show-scorecard~ displays scorecard for the match at the pointer in
  match list (index) view.
+ ~cricbuzz-refresh-scorecard~ refreshes the current scorecard view.
